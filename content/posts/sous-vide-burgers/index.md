This is a nice way to make fat burgers, fully pasteurized while leaving the inside at the desired level of doneness. I've experimented with temperatures between 125F and 135F, and usually do 125. I set it for 2 hours and sometimes take it out at after 90 min. Sous vide is very forgiving, basically do whatever you want. I use burger rings which makes it easy to get a perfectly-shaped patty with minimal labor. I buy the 1 pound packs of beef, and take half out, drop it inside a ring, and mash it down until it's flat. So 1 pack makes 2 patties, with the 1/2 pound rings. The 11" wide vacuum bags that I buy are the perfect width to have 2 of these patties side by side. Season as desired. I typically use salt or nothing at all.

When I cut the vacuum bag open, I pour the juice into a little condiment cup and drink it with my meal. No food goes to waste!

Best practice is to let these burgers rest, apparently. I usually don't wait too long, but they might turn out soggy if you don't let them rest. Searing them while they're wet is bad, I think. Definitely sear it though, it tastes a lot better with a crust. I do this on cast iron, on a camping stove (outside in the backyard, because I don't have an range/exhaust fan and I don't want my house smelling like burger smoke!) The burgers are already safe to eat after removing it from sous vide. Just sear it until your desired crust is achieved.

As you can see, there's room for a lot more burgers in here. I typically only cook for myself, so the most I've done is four at a time. I'm sure that it could fit at least eight though. Possibly ten.
