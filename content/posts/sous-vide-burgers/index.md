Nice way to make fat burgers, fully pasteurized while leaving the inside at the desired level of doneness. I've experimented with temperatures between 125F and 135F, and usually do 125. I set it for 2 hours and sometimes take it out at after 90 min. I use burger rings which makes it easy to get a perfectly-shaped patty with minimal labor. I buy the 1 pound packs of beef, and take half out, drop it inside a ring, and mash it down until it's flat. So 1 pack makes 2 patties, with the 1/2 pound rings. The 11" wide vacuum bags that I buy are the perfect width to have 2 of these patties side by side. Season as desired. I typically use salt or nothing at all.

When I cut the vacuum bag open, I pour the juice into a little condiment cup and drink it with my meal. No food goes to waste!
